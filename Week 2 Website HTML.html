  <h1>BP's Gaming Entertainmet Website</h1>
  <p>The goal of my project is to create a website that features the works of a game streamer, commentator, and programmer. The gaming industry is on an ever increase rise and the population of professional gamers, critics, and machinima artists is right in tow. The primary goal of the website would be to produce professional videos coupled with witty shock-humor and post-editing to produce a more artistic product.</p>
  <p>The primary audience that content would be targeting would be young adult due to the content material. The gaming market is heavily diverse, as it is no longer just children playing games. Gamers who started playing on the original consoles of the 70's and 80's have not given up their interests in video games. As such, there is a large market for entertainment with a mature theme, with mature language being one of the largest elements represented. This is not to say that it is unprofessional, as mature conversation material has proliferated into many mainstream markets today such as television, regardless of if it is premium or network cable.</p>
  <p>There will be live streams of video games from websites such as Twitch.tv or YouTubeGaming, edited for time presentations of said streams focusing on highlights within the stream, machinima videos or elements of machinima overlays onto game or commentary videos, and accompanying support elements such as blogs and links to Twitter and Facebook media services. Various design concepts would include webcaster designed graphic art for the background style, custom animations within the navigation bar, direct linking to the social network services and Twitch.tv as well as subscriber sign-up and donator support features.</p>
  <p>Because HTML is the foundational language of most every functional website on the internet, it is quintessential to the development of this website. The versatility of HTML permits the coding for the website to be easily translated across most platforms and peripherals through tools such as -webkit- and -moz- for example. HTML is also beneficial in that it can easily be coded onto Wordpad or ideally Notepad++ where the syntax can be easily identified and corrected as needed. CSS is a conjunctive element to designing in HTML, as it is what produces the aesthetic flair to the website. If CSS were not utilized, then websites would appear even more dull than this page; this site containing four basic CSS elements used eight times.</p>
  <p>With proper structure comes proper execution. Though forgiving at times, proper syntax is superlative when writing any code, including HTML and CSS. Though a missed ";" won't always ruin your website it could produce errors that, compounded with other grammatical errors, could cause an aesthetic "hiccup" or worse, inability to properly display something across all platforms accessing the site. Proper structure of the document is also important when it comes to design as well. A programmer should always properly indent and categorize the elements of the source code so that should any issue arise, it is easily read, identified, and corrected. While theoretically the website would function were only the appropriate symbols and commands in place; looking at the source code would be an eyesore.</p>
  <p>By the beginning of week four, I would like to have a good idea of what the website would be like; even if only written on a traditional wireframe. I would also be sure to have style concepts ready so that I could focus on putting them into code after week four. Fortunately I have some content that cant be put on to the website, so that isn't a huge concern, but I would like to be able to have some art created before week six; a logo being one of the art pieces to construct.</p>
