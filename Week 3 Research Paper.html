  <h1>The Evolving Internet</h1>
  <h2><p>The Internet has become an essential element of mainstream society, proliferating into nearly every market and economic figure as well as it's use in the private social networking industry e.g Facebook, Twitter, Imgur, etc. All of this having been achieved within the last 50 years! The internet, arguably, had its humble beginnings within the notes of J.C.R. Licklider while he was at MIT in 1962; a concept he referred to as his "Galactic Network". (Leiner 2015) After the implementation of his base theories in the form of ARPANET, inter-terminal communication began to expand exponentially; the limitations of the fledgling systemsexpansions limited by the affordability of the necessary technologies. (Leiner 2015)</p></h2>
  <h2><p>Today, the Internet is not only accessible, but affordable and customizable. The technologies and techniques are made available to the general public and with how prevalent shareware and freedom of information movements are, Web standardization is absolutely necessary so as to make every site easily translated by all systems. The World Wide Web Consortium(W3C) is a coalition which is recognized as the governing entity for what is "status quo" for web based construction; HTML5 being the expected cornerstone language. (Keio 2015) The Semantic Web is a concept that the W3C is striving to make a reality; a database of information in the more traditional sense, having a Semantic we would permit the end-users to not only access information, but develop libraries, vocabularies, and further expand the communicative as well as constructive capabilites if the Internet as a whole. (Keio 2015)</p></h2>
  <h2><p> Implementation of a universally translatable Web is achieved by disciplining writers to follow a certain modality of thought. In the cases of Graceful Degradation and Progressive enhancement, these to function in opposite directions. Graceful Degradation is the construction of a website so that it is understood by platforms spanning multiple generations, meaning that the newest system will have full  access to a website, albeit far below the modern devices capabilities. This permits older platforms to be able to understand what the site is trying to populate on the device. (W3C 2015) Progressive enhancement/Adaptive Web design works on an opposite logic framework. Progressive enhancement construction would start with an extremely basic construct designed to be refined over-and-over again to adapt it to newer platforms as technologies advance. (W3C 2015) Another concept of construction is Responsive Web design, which is also known as RWD. This architecture focuses on building sites with the type and not necessarily the age of the device being the primary focus; coding websites in this fashion means the intent is to make it readable by desktops, cellular phones, tablets, and other web-accessible devices universally, without having feature or content loss between the platforms. (Howe 2015) With the ever increasing utilization of mobile, internet capable devices, having a Mobile first Web design is a front-runner for coding logic. Design from a mobile first standpoint means the focus is on selecting content that is better suited to a mobile device than a desktop; provides the ability to tap into the mobile market by consistently providing full feature websites for your cellular phone or tablet. (SitePoint 2015) Being certain to be future-friendly with design is essential across all methods of execution. Technology advances daily, if not sooner than that; to not have a mind for the advancement of technology, as well as the corresponding design tools, will doom the advancement of a website into the future.</p></h2>
  <h2><p>The Internet is a fascinating creature of man, ever evolving, and at an ever accelerating rate. Due to its versatility and exponential advancement, programmers need to have a very forward-focus mindset, whilst still trying to keep foundational systems and techniques in mind. If one doesn't consider the predecessors, then you alienate a large portion of the market and make your site inaccessible to a huge potential market. On the other side of the coin, if one caters too much to the now and doesn't consider the to come or coming, then you leave your site dated and uninteresting to the high-end technology consumers that may want to access your site. Web design is a fickle creature, and one must be vigilant in the construction, and advancement of the Web and it's supporting features.</p></h2>
